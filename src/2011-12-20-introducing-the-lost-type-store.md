We’ve been talking about a Lost Type Official Store for quite some time, and we are proud to announce that our first 2 products are [here](http://losttype.com/store/)!

Included in our [inaugural product lineup](http://losttype.com/store/) are **The Ribbon Specimen Book**, and **The Official Button Kit**. Both of which are the hard work of many designers, whom we are honored to have worked with.

Brand new on the shelf is the **Official Button Kit**, a set of 5 randomly selected (and specially designed) Lost Type 1″ Pin Buttons. The package itself, featuring a word pattern by [Linda Eliasen](http://lindaeliasen.com/), Custom lettering by [James Edmondson](http://work.jamestedmondson.com/), a back panel illustration by [Justin Mezzell](http://justinmezzell.com/), and the design and hand fabrication of [Jim Leszczynski](http://jimleszczynski.com/), was truly a group effort in the spirit of Lost Type itself.
Big thanks to Jim, for making this thing real. You’ll even find our ‘Purpose Made’ badge by [Richie Stewart](www.commonerinc.com), on a pin.

**The Ribbon Specimen Book** (introduced in October), is a 35 page custom bound book in a limited edition of 300\. The brainchild of [Dan Gneiding](http://grayhood.com/about/), the book features spreads by our talented designer friends, including [Linda Eliasen](http://dribbble.com/lindaeliasen), [Mauricio Cremer](http://thesgnl.com/), [Chaun Osburn](http://www.urbaninfluence.com/), [Jim Leszczynski](http://jimleszczynski.com/), [Olivia Verdugo](http://viaver.com/), [Elysse Ricci](http://www.elyssericci.com/), [Andy Rementer](http://andyrementer.com/), [Namik Schwarz](http://www.visuelnoir.com/), [Lachlan Heywood](http://www.hellotimber.com/) and [Ryan Katrina](http://neuarmy.com/).

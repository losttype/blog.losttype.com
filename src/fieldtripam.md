For seven days, a handful of Lost Type’s designers will live under one roof with a common goal: to source inspiration for type and lettering from the city of New York. We’ll also be visiting with the local talent and journaling our adventures on this blog. Check back for live updates!

Our third—and first international—trip found us in Amsterdam and Copenhagen. We documented a whole new set of historical type and lettering spanning back over 400 years. We even had the honor of spotting some of our own typefaces in this historical landscape, which was a wonderful reminder that the work we’re doing is used all across the world. While in Amsterdam we shared even more found type and lettering on Instagram ([250 photos!](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripam)) and again wrote blog posts about the places we visited, the tools we were using for lettering during the trip, and the places we’d spotted Lost Type fonts in use.

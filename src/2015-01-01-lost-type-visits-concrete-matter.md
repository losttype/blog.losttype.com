Our time in Amsterdam wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Lost Type contributor Tim Boelaar’s store, [Concrete Matter](http://www.concrete-matter.com). Tim, along with Tomas and Jacob, opened Concrete Matter as an [online shop](http://www.concrete-matter.com/collections/store) in 2012 and the physical location on Amsterdam’s Haarlemmerdijk in 2013.

Tim, Tomas and Jacob’s excellent taste manifests in a beautifully curated store: school maps, prints, globes, pins, books, model kits, and memorabilia that is all well-crafted and durable. Many of the products are sold in packaging that looks as though it hasn’t been updated since the 1940s.

Of course we admired [James Edmondson](http://jamestedmondson.com/)’s handiwork on the door, commemorating the store opening on October 3, 2013.

Visit Concrete Matter for one-of-a-kind gifts and goods (for yourself and others):

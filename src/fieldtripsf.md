For four days, a handful of Lost Type’s designers lived under one roof with a common goal: to create a typeface inspired by San Francisco. We visited with the local talent, ventured into the city to search for inspiration, and documented the entire trip!

Our first trip to San Francisco yielded a huge amount of inspiration, and allowed many Lost Type contributors to meet in person for the first time. We lived under the same roof together for 7 days, and gathered inspiration for future projects. This trip really set the tone for our future trips, and yielded several typefaces including [Dude](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=dude), [Mission Gothic](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=missiongothic), [Mission Script](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=mission_script) and [Fairview](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=fairview). We continually Instagrammed ([175 photos!](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripsf)) and maintained a live blog, which you can read below.

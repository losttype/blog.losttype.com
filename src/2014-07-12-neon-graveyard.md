I have a lot of respect and admiration for places that value and care for elements and objects that gave identity and laid the foundation of their city.

One such case is the Neon Museum I visited recently, where we travel back in time to see the Neon Signs that founded Las Vegas. Marquees that still amaze us today.

Personally I’m a fan of this type of work where there are lots of _cowboy_ styles with perfectly placed neon lights and bulbs. Several of them have different timing patterns that generate different effects when you observe them.

Signs such as _Stardust_ to _Sassy Saly’s_ etc., make us want to travel in a time machine to Freemont Street about 30 or 40 years ago when these neon lights glowed in the desert.

Our friend Eric R. Mortensen has teamed up once more with Jessica Heltzel and Tim Hoover (creators of the[ Kern and Burn book/site][2] that we blogged recently) and started a super fun new project called [The People&#8217;s Pennant][1].

Each month a limited edition run of 250 Pennants (created by notable artists and designers) are hand sewn and printed the USA, and sold for $35 + shipping and handling.

**For a limited time only: Tweet a link to this post for a chance to win a free [Richard Perez Pennant][3]! Winner will be chosen at random on March 21st.**

&#8220;***Rally around the small things in life!** Driving with the windows down. Lazy Sundays. A freshly sharpened pencil. Whatever it is that makes you happy, we want to celebrate it. So we bring you: The People&#8217;s Pennant. We elevate the pennant from the confines of sports to the awesomeness of the everyday. Our pennants are hand-printed and hand-sewn in the U.S.A. Crafted by folks who&#8217;ve helped shape the tradition since the early 1900s, they have produced felt products with care for home-town victories to world championships. Collect all of the pennants, and show some team spirit for the small things in life.*&#8221;

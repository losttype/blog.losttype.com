What discipline(s) do you specialize in? Design, sometimes. And art direction, if you can call it that. Mostly just making fun of everything and having fun with everyone.

What's your typical day like? Wake up, carpool with my wife, annoy everyone at work, design, annoy, design, carpool with my wife, hang with the family, design, repeat (if I’m lucky).

How did you first get interested in typography / lettering / type design? I used to draw/create my own Nike shoes, create baseball/basketball cards, and redraw sports team logos.

So... How do you feel about Hobo? Hobo, just for the name alone.

Whats your favorite breakfast food? Eggs over easy. And bacon.

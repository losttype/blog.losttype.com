The Lost Type Co-op’s Field Trip bring together some of North America’s most talented graphic designers, type designers, and lettering artists, for a site-specific marathon of collaboration.

Following our successful [trip to Amsterdam](/fieldtripam) last year, we’ll return to the United States for [#fieldtripchi](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripchi) in Chicago. We’re thrilled to head to the Windy City to document its type and lettering, and to meet with local designers and respected industry professionals.

__Name__ Frances MacLeod

__Where do you currently live and work?__ Chicago, Illinois.

__What discipline do you specialize in?__ Lettering, branding, [pattern design](http://www.designsponge.com/2015/07/pattern-download-from-frances-macleod-day-1.html), snacks.

__What’s your typical day like?__ I work in the [Department of Design](http://lbdod.com/) at Leo Burnett (http://leoburnett.com/), a pretty big advertising agency based here in Chicago. Most days involve sleeping later than I intended, dry shampooing my hair, then grabbing coffee at Intelligentsia in Logan Square before joining the other sardines taking the train downtown for work.

I eat greek yogurt at my desk (I rotate flavors depending on my mood, just got pretty into this blueberry one that has chia seeds in it), read a bunch of blogs, and work on whatever’s on my plate. Our group isn’t dedicated to one specific client, so I end up working on projects ranging from really big campaigns to pro-bono to internal initiatives. Lately we’ve been eating lunch together as a team in our corner of the office because we Genuinely Enjoy Each Other.

In the afternoons I check in on projects and work some more. Sometimes I get a snack (often an ice cold LaCroix and 25 cent box of lemonheads from the convenience store downstairs, but a soft serve ice cream cone when the mood calls for it). On free evenings, I get dinner with friends in Logan Square or head to my studio space to work on personal/freelance projects.

__How did you first get interested in typography, lettering, and type design?__ I read an esteemed text from the American Girl Library around age 10 that opened me up to the possibilities of lettering and typography. I practiced my handwriting in middle school, but it was halfway through college before I realized the things I liked to draw for fun could be a focus in my work.

So… How do you feel about Hobo?

I had largely neutral opinion of Hobo (kind of like “Do people really use that for stuff?”) until James T. Edmondson took it upon himself [to revive it](http://www.ohnotype.co/product/hobeaux). Now I’m trying to find a project worthy of it.

__What’s your favorite breakfast food?__ I love all the foods, but what I really appreciate in a breakfast restaurant is potato versatility. Give me options, show me you care: hashbrowns (patties, shredded, smashed), home fries, tater tots. The potatoes make the breakfast memorable. An example: I always forget what I ordered at [Bakin and Eggs](http://www.bakinandeggschicago.com/home.php), but absolutely every time I get their house potatoes because they are remarkably terrific (they’re also sprinkled with herbes de provence, I know because I asked).

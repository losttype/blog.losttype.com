<p class="dropcap-container" data-dropcap="A"><span class="js-dropcap dropcap">A</span>nd so the trip has come to an end. I’m writing this from my apartment in San Francisco. I was one of the first to leave this morning, while everyone was still sleeping off their hangover. It was a weird and sad feeling to walk out that apartment, as this past week has been somewhat magical.</p>

I had no idea what I was in for before I flew out to Brooklyn, but by the end of the week, I got to know this amazing group of people. What a week. Thanks, Lost Type.

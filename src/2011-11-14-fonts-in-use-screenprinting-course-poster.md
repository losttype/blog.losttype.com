[Graham Dylan Pilling][1] (aka Army of Cats) worked up little screen printing lesson for some students, and made some nice use of [Ribbon][2].

*&#8220;So this weekend myself and good friend Cameron Steward (<a href="http://www.twoducksdisco.co.uk/" target="_blank">twoducksdisco.co.uk</a>) taught our first Screenprinting Course at <a href="http://www.wypw.org/" target="_blank">WYPW</a>, the place where we both print. I&#8217;m very happy to report we were both really pleased with how it went.&#8221;*

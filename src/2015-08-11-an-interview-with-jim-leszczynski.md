> I’m proud of Jim. Having started working with LT when he was in college, he now runs his own design studio, [Good Behavior](http://goodbehavior.co), and continues to collaborate with LT on projects ranging from the button kits in our store to type specimens and other additions. He’s a hard working and kind hearted person, the world could use more people like him.

__What’s your typical day like?__ Every day is a little different! After deciding wether or not pants are required for the day, I spend time training my dog in the mornings and working late. Running my own shop has allowed a lot of flexibility to budget my time doing the things I love most.

__How did you first get interested in typography / lettering / type design?__ I first discovered the power of typography at my internship with Moxie Sozo in Boulder, CO. I thought it was fascinating how type and lettering were incorporated into their packaging and print collateral. Some of this experience translated to projects with Lost Type, like our button kits.

__So… How do you feel about Curlz MT?__ Curlz MT is super cute! What would elementary school teachers and dance studios use if we didn’t have it?

__What's your favorite breakfast food?__ The obvious and only answer to this question – for all individuals on this bountiful green earth – is bacon.

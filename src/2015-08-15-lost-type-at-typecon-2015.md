We’re excited to be in Denver, CO for [TypeCon 2015: Condensed](http://typecon.com)!

Riley and I just wrapped up an amazing week on the [Lost Type Field Trip to Chicago](/fieldtripchi). We lived with nine contributors, researched some of the type and lettering histroy in the city, and planned new projects for Lost Type—It was tough to say goodbye to everyone, but now we get to spend time with even more contributors here at TypeCon.

If you’re at the conference, make sure to say hello to [Riley Cran](https://twitter.com/rileycran) and [me](https://twitter.com/kennethormandy), or one of the other LT contributors here, including [James T. Edmondson](https://twitter.com/jamestedmondson), and [Shiva Nallaperumal](https://twitter.com/shiva__n).

We’ll have plenty more research and stories to come on TypeCon, [#fieldtripchi](/fieldtripchi) and the new [@losttypecoop Instagram](https://instagram.com/losttypecoop).

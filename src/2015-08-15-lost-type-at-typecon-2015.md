Riley and I had an amazing time on the [Lost Type Field Trip to Chicago](/fieldtripchi), where we spent a week with nine amazing contributors, researched some of the type and lettering histroy in the city, and planned new projects for Lost Type.

It was tough to say goodbye to everyone, but we’re also excited to be in Denver, CO for [TypeCon 2015: Condensed ](http://typecon.com).

If you’re at TypeCon, make sure to say hello to [Riley Cran](https://twitter.com/rileycran) and [me](https://twitter.com/kennethormandy), or one of the other LT contributors here, including [James T. Edmondson](https://twitter.com/jamestedmondson) and [Shiva Nallaperumal](https://twitter.com/shiva__n).

We’ll have plenty more research and stories to come on TypeCon, [#fieldtripchi](/fieldtripchi) and the new [@losttypecoop Instagram](https://instagram.com/losttypecoop).

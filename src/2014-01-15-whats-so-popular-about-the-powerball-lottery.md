You&#8217;ll find people all over the US playing the Powerball lottery.  Some even wrap their lives around when to play, how much, and what numbers they&#8217;ll choose. It&#8217;s become not only an industry but an event of major proportions like a big entertainment venue.

 

People hold Powerball lottery parties to see if anyone even gets close to the winning numbers. It&#8217;s sort of an excuse to have friends and family get together for the evening and enjoy one another&#8217;s company.  Some people take their Powerball fun to churches and school events like Bingo night.  It&#8217;s all in the name of spending a few dollars and hoping to hit it big in the lottery.

 

The way it is played is that it is in actuality 45 lotteries that share a jackpot.  Let’s [learn more about PowerBall lottery (Faqs).][1] The setup is that each state in the country that has the lottery is part of the MUSL aka Multi-State Lottery Association.  This group is a nonprofit one.

The way the lottery works is that the numbers people pick for the jackpot if missed, and then the jackpot rolls over to the next lottery date.  No big issue or confusion here.  So far the largest Powerball jackpot was just over $590 million dollars that was won in the month of May, 2013 in Florida.  That made that jackpot the third largest worldwide to this date.  If a person wins, their annuity is paid out in 30 graduated installments or they can choose to cash out instead.  The numbers used in the game are only 59 in total so 1 to 59 and 1/35 matrix.  The game is played twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

 

For just $2 a player picks their numbers or has the computer at the store do so.  Five are the numbers they pick from that playing field of 59 white balls and 35 red balls.  The Powerball uses a two-drum process with the white balls in one drum and the red balls in another.  One can pick a number in the white balls section from 1 to 35 and still match a red ball with the same number but the red balls only go up to 35.

 

In addition, there is a feature called Power Play that goes along with the Powerball game.  It allows for a multiplication of winnings based on a 10x multiplier.

 

When someone wins, they can either cash out, which means two installments or as a graduated annuity paid over a 30 year period of annual installments.  The advantage of the annuity payment is that it gets 4% higher each year than the previous year.  Number crunchers would find it difficult to turn that down.

 

After each jackpot, the clock turns back to a guaranteed $40 million per contest.  If that contest isn&#8217;t won, an additional $10 million is tacked on.  Winners have to claim the ticket where the ticket was purchased.

 

One other note, you&#8217;ll have to be 18 years or older to play.

 

Overall, the Powerball lottery has become one of the most successful lotteries in history.  There are more fine tuned details in how to play and what goes on behind the scenes regarding earnings but it&#8217;s all good.

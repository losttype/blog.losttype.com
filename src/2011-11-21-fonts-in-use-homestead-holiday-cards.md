[Paper Plates Press][1] made nice use of [Homestead][2] in their new holiday cards. 

*&#8220;Our first of two letterpress holiday cards this year was inspired by our annoying neighbors, the pine beetles. Yep, they’ve done a number on the Colorado landscape, leaving a sea of brown, dead pine trees in their wake. So with some wishful thinking, and some unfavorable weather, we hope to never speak their name again in 2012. Find the card in our <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/PaperPlatesPress" target="_blank">Etsy Shop</a>.</p> 

And a little bonus. The wonderful font we used, Homestead, was created by Colorado born Luke Lisi.&#8221;</em>

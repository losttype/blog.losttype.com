<span>When the Internet began to grown into our lives, many <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism">neo&#8211;Luddites</a>&nbsp;were not finished complaining about the effects of TV on literacy. TV was a big part of postmodernism; it might be fair to say that the Web generations are part of the next 'ism. However, we might want to think through the impression that spending time online hurts literacy or even a general love of the printed word.</span>

# <span>Unlikely Typographies</span>

<span>As far as we can tell, word-forms are exploding online &#8212; and the Web is also retrieving lost typefaces. Strangely, like the ol' Web 1.0 generally, most online operations had been text based, yet devoid of typographical personality &#8212; those crunchy screen fonts looked as if designed for the pleasure of computers taught to read.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Steve Jobs did the world a favor, by foregrounding the importance of typography in the budding stages of personal computers and screen technology. Both of those, typography and sharp screens (good for reading) have been hallmarks of Apple products' superior quality and finish.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Now, with the addition of HTML v5 (in 2013) and powerful, convergent, and centralized Web-browser formatting for the word, we may be entering a real renaissance of type.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><h2>Unexpected Font Sources</h2></span>

&nbsp;

<span>If you scan quickly your memory and knowledge of pop culture, parsing for types of entertainment that can be counted upon for exciting typography &#8230; what do you see?</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Sports, to some extent, are accompanied by bold fonts, when sports appear online, sure. But that visual style is homogenous. There are many other examples that can be weighed. For example, a fun one is casinos (linked to the luxurious fonts of Las Vegas). </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Now, to bring this back around to the Web: did you know that the casino entertainment industry has been staking itself heavily in online gaming for many years now, raking in billions? And do you know, there are an awful lot of zany, crazy, creative typefaces popping up in casino games made by the hottest studios (many using the same talent pool of artists as Pixar and Disney)?</span>

&nbsp;

<span id="docs-internal-guid-5e9d86c8-de9d-8cb9-d2e5-48a4d33cf15b">In fact, animated cinema is a robust source of textual art, and those same digital designers and animators have been hired by studios like Net|Ent in Sweden (Internet Entertainment), which are cranking out very popular cinema-quality online slots, live card games and so forth.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>We think that cruizing through a good <a href="http://www.classycasinos.co.uk/paypal-casinos/">pay pal casino</a> may surprise any lover of fonts, and, it's an instance of how the Web is starting to behave very typographically in general, turning up fresh looks for text and words in unexpected places like a mobile casino game.</span>

Have you ever noticed our little &#8216;Factory&#8217; illustration, in the footer of every page?

It was designed by our talented friend [Tim Boelaars][1], who just released [his new shop][2]!

He&#8217;s expanded his signature mono-weight style into a gorgeous set of posters, each with a series of categorial illustrations. Great job buddy!

You [may have seen][1] that The Lost Type Co-op is headed to Amsterdam soon (!!!). We’ll be there the 19th–26th of this month. This is Lost Type’s third field trip (previous adventures included New York and San Francisco) and over ten of us will be attending!

While we’re in Amsterdam, we’ll be sourcing inspiration for upcoming display face, typeface and lettering projects.

Turns out we’re not the only ones who are excited… and into making fonts. This letter arrived today. Thanks, Grandma!

And many thanks to [Dropbox][2], our awesome sponsor.

Keep your eyes on this blog and the Lost Type twitter for updates on our adventures!

You [may have seen][1] that The Lost Type Co-op is headed to Amsterdam soon (!!!). We&#8217;ll be there the 19th–26th of this month. This is Lost Type&#8217;s third field trip (previous adventures included New York and San Francisco) and over ten of us will be attending!

While we&#8217;re in Amsterdam, we&#8217;ll be sourcing inspiration for upcoming display face, typeface and lettering projects.

Turns out we&#8217;re not the only ones who are excited&#8230; and into making fonts. This letter arrived today. Thanks, Grandma!

And many thanks to [Dropbox][2], our awesome sponsor.

Keep your eyes on this blog and the Lost Type twitter for updates on our adventures!

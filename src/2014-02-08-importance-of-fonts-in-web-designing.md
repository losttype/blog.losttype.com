There are a few important reasons why fonts are considered even more important than website graphics when creating a web page. This may sound odd, but it&rsquo;s true.

Basically, a website needs to be as clear as nice: all messages should be easy to understand and well written, but also they have to be written using a [nice font][1].

When you use fonts you can have two important tools that allow you to define the hierarchy of your content: size and color.

A big font can attract the eyes better than a smaller one. And colors in contrast can help you underline important words.

## Different kinds of fonts

Different fonts can help differentiate the kind of messages you want to send the readers. If you look at a webpage, you can notice that different fonts are used. This is not only to give a lively look to the webpage, but also to meet particular exigencies, such as the need to highlight the title and main content.

Moreover, you can still use bold and cursive fonts and different stylized fonts in contrast to standard fonts: a good choice of all these elements can contribute to create a nice design effect on your webpage.

## Advertising needs right fonts

A good example to understand why fonts are so important in the web would be to look at an advertising page. Images and colors create a nice looking page so that the viewers will stop and read.

You should always think to use appropriate fonts as to the kind of message or info you are willing to spread. For an online game like the lotto games on [Lottery Planet][2] you should have a look at this website.

As you can see, the main color is light blue which suggests quietness and serenity. A good series of info about the lotto games is put on the right so that any viewer will find it naturally easy to read. And on the left side next to the latest news and articles, you can find the last results of the last lotto draws: Mega Millions, Euro Millions, Bono Loto.

At the end of the page, more info about how to buy the lottery tickets and how to play can be read in an easy way. Lottery tickets can be directly on the website of Lottery planet purchased: the more tickets you buy the more chances to get a prize you will have.

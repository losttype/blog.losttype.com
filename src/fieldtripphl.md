The Lost Type Co-op’s Field Trip bring together some of North America’s most talented graphic designers, type designers, and lettering artists, for a site-specific marathon of collaboration. Following our first ever trip to Canada earlier this year, we’re heading back to the USA for [#fieldtripphl](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripphl).

Hosted by one of Lost Type’s most prolific and most unpredictable contributors, Dan [“Grayhood”](http://grayhood.com) Gneiding, we’ll be touring the city, working together, and meeting the design community in Philadelphia.

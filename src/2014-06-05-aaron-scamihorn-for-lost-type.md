Years ago, when we first put up a store to sell physical items on our site, I asked my talented pal [Aaron Scamihorn][1] if he was up for drawing a banner image. And he took it literally! He put together a killer illustrated banner and put some of our fonts to use.

Recently when it came time to celebrate the launch of our [latest store design and some new products][2], I thought back to Aaron’s original banner, and asked him if he’d consider doing another as a nod. I am really pleased that Aaron was around to design these several years apart, and I love what he cooked up. 

Head on over to the store and check out some of our latest products, the [Manicule Pin][3] and our [illustrated poster by Scotty Reifsnyder][4]. 

Below you’ll see the current banner, the original banner, and a tiled pattern of 3’s found in our fonts, to celebrate Lost Type turning 3 years old.

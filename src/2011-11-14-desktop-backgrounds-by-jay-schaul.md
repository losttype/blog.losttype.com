Back when we initially launched, we asked our buddy [Jay Schaul][1] to draw up some desktop wallpapers for us. Its about time we mention these again. They are just as beautiful today as they were back in May. He made 4 all in all, including versions for the iPhone and iPad.  
Download the complete set [here][2].

Our second trip took us a city overflowing with typographic history and inspiration. Again staying under one roof for a week, we explored both Brooklyn and Manhattan, documenting our favorite pieces of found type and lettering and assembling an understanding of the vernacular aesthetic of NYC.

This project, like [the one before it](/fieldtripsf), yielded many type and lettering projects, as well as new collaborations and friendships. This time we Instagrammed even more ([220 photos!](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripny)), and again shared our adventures via the live blog below.

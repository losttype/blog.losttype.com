> In addition to being one of Lost Type’s most prolific contributors, [Dan Gneiding](https://twitter.com/grayhood) is one of my favorite people on these Field Trips, for his mix of humor, storytelling and logistical skills. Dan is one of the people that truly keep Lost Type running smoothly, and the same applies to the Field Trips. Dan is usually the first one to arrive and the last to leave.

__Name__ Dan “Grayhood” Gneiding

__Based in__ Philadelphia, PA

__What discipline do you specialize in?__ 8-bit poop animations.

__What’s your typical day like?__ Like a meme, wrapped in a mystery, deep fried in a conundrum and smothered with cheese.

__How did you first get interested in typography / lettering / type design?__ It all started for me when i used to copy the logos of my favorite bands and/or comic book art/lettering.

__So… How do you feel about Curlz MT?__ I dig Curls MT b/c the name reminds me of cheese curls which are not a far cry from Doritos… mmmmmm Doritos…

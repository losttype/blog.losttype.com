__How did you first get interested in typography, lettering, and type design?__ I remember reading Jimmy Corrigan by Chris Ware in high school and being blown away by the lettering. Visiting Chicago with a group of letter enthusiasts really completes that loop, seeing that Jimmy Corrigan takes place predominantly in Chicago. My favorite part of the book is when the Superman archetype leaps off a tall building to his death, and bystanders indifferently observe before continuing on with their day.

__So… How do you feel about Hobo?__ I believe Hobo is one of the most criminally misunderstood typefaces of our generation, and I'm thrilled to see James Edmondson restore it to it’s Art Nouveau glory.

__Whats your favorite breakfast food?__ Grapefruit Juice, Coffee, and Lox on a toasted everything bagel, with cream cheese, onions, tomatoes, and capers if you got them.

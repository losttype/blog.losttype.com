After [the clown suit debacle](/visit-to-the-hamilton-wood-type-museum-pt-1), we made our way to the back of the museum, where for a small fee we were given free-range to print with a large variety of wood typefaces. Although we were only given a few hours, we came away with some great specimens.

The following day, we arrived at the museum bright and early to chat with [Jim Moran](http://woodtype.org/about/staff) about his role at Hamilton, as well as his many other insights about letterpress printing, and design in general.

Once we wrapped up our interview with Jim, we spent some time exploring the museum, making sure to document any other things we could have easily overlooked.

On our way out, we exited through the museum gift shop. We bought a reprint by [Stephanie Carpenter](http://www.stephaniercarpenter.com/), the assistant director of the museum, of an advertising cut featuring a frightened woman straight out of an R. Crumb comic.

I left the Hamilton Wood Type Museum feeling more inspired than ever. To witness a convergence of so many talented designers, printers, and craftspeople in one space is jaw dropping. It’s an incredible resource, and I would recommend anyone that is passionate about the history of display typography make the trip to Two Rivers.

A few months back [For Print Only][1] covered a nice mailer project by [MCM Communications][2], which features [Wisdom Script][3], [Deming][4], [Duke][5], [Aldine Expanded][6] and [Pompadour Numerals][7] on a screen-printed box.

*The “Free Your Brand” box is a self-promo mailer from the agency to key prospective clients as a creative new business outreach strategy. Designed to match MCM’s brand standards and personality, the enclosed print piece tells a fast, yet funny story about the challenges and opportunities our clients face every day. The mailing box itself is designed as a teaser of what’s inside—inspiring higher open rates.*

__What disciplines do you specialize in?__ Illustrative lettering, [sheepherding](http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2010/04/01/1270141387_4912/539w.jpg), and swizzle-sticking

__What's your typical day like?__ I wake up [without an alarm](http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/wellness_articles.asp?id=329) around 7 or 7:30, and I immediately do some [yoga](http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/61512/yoga-pants.jpg?w=650) and [stretches](http://chiropam.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/everyday-stretches.jpg). I always like to start my day with some [fresh fruit](http://blog.joslin.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fruits1.jpg) and [chia pudding](http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Chia-Pudding-Recipe-34333463) I’ve made the night before, along with an [Americano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano) made with freshly ground beans from [Bed Stuy Local](http://www.bedstuyfreshandlocal.net/) in my favorite mug by [Josephine Noel](http://www.recreationcentershop.com/). I also treat myself to some [fresh juice](http://justjuice.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/fresh-fruit-juice.jpg), a [smoothie](http://www.milkmeansmore.org/blog/legacy_files/2013/08/Couple-Drinking-Milk.jpg%5C), or [homemade granola](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Sand_from_Gobi_Desert.jpg). I’ll then run over to the farmer’s market to pick up the fresh fruits needed for tomorrow’s morning ritual.

<div data-pullquote="I work until I feel good about how much I’ve accomplished, and then I work a little more."></div>

I compose an overly ambitious [list](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/to-do-list-tasks-clipboard-checkmark-words-remember-goals-checklist-wooden-word-career-top-priorities-31478262.jpg) of daily goals, both professional and personal and jump in. I usually complete about 30% of them due to my many many friends on Facebook, Instagram and [Tweeter](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-02/5/16/enhanced/webdr06/anigif_enhanced-buzz-26961-1423170213-16.gif) (I’m sure you’re familiar with these websites!). I work until I feel good about how much I’ve accomplished, and then I work a little more. The reason I stop working at all is because my [sexy](http://giphy.com/gifs/sexy-stephen-colbert-lick-KAyCDfOolR8hq/tile) [hubby](http://www.spencercharles.com/) texts me to remind me that I need to eat.

After my very [important](http://giphy.com/gifs/puppy-animated-12CU8VuAS0dAzu/fullscreen) endeavors, I might head over to meet my [sexy](http://giphy.com/gifs/sexy-stephen-colbert-lick-KAyCDfOolR8hq/tile) [hubby](http://www.spencercharles.com/) at the [Pencil Factory](http://pencilfactory.biz/) and we go eat [various Polish foods](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/07603_pierogi_zapiekane_z_kapusta_i_kminem.jpg) or drink [fancy mixed drinks](http://giphy.com/gifs/beer-the-simpsons-3vDFxcB9vZNNS) with friends, or just have a [casual dinner for 2](http://aprilchantel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/candlelight-dinner-on-the-water.jpg). Then we’ll saunter home and Spencer will s my d.

How did you first get interested in typography, lettering, and type design?
In the 5th grade, I wrote a book named <cite>Nightmare of the Living Dummy</cite> (Please don’t sue me, RL Stine) and I illustrated the entire thing complete with [spooky, wacky letters](http://www.6dembroiderysystem.com/assets/img/Lettering/Scary/Spooky-Outline/4.jpg) I loved being able to communicate in that way, especially because I truly thought that my novella was extremely frightening and that my letters added that extra **oomph**.

__So… How do you feel about Curlz MT?__ Pretty sure I used Curlz for **all body copy** in <cite>Nightmare of the Living Dummy</cite>. It was siiiiiiiiiiick.

__Whats your favorite breakfast food?__ [Lots of things](http://previews.123rf.com/images/elnur/elnur1203/elnur120300961/12531092-Circle-with-lots-of-food-items-Stock-Photo-food-pyramid-diet.jpg) but my palette is particularly partial to leftover Chinese food.

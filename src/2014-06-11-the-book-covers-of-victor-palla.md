  While scrolling the depths of book cover treasure trove <a href="http://livingdeadcovers.wordpress.com/"><span class="s1">livingdeadcovers</span></a>, I noticed the recurrence of designer Victor Palla. In post-war Portugal, Palla founded a series of publishing houses that published both imported translations and political titles. Most of his design work is limited to this period and the production methods available in mid-century Europe, but his architectural training and spatial sensibilities are evident in the various disciplines he explored before his death in 2006.

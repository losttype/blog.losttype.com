We are very excited to be traveling to Amsterdam for our third Field Trip.

Prior years have taken us to [San Francisco](http://fieldtripsf.com) and [New York](http://fieldtripny.com), and this trip is our first to leave the continent.

A dozen designers from Lost Type (and from our kind sponsor, [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)) will be in Amsterdam from September 19th-26th.

Check back here soon for more updates!

P.S. Thanks to [Cade Cran](http://cadecran.com) and [Neil Secretario](http://neilsecretario.com/) for this year’s logo and lettering, respectively!

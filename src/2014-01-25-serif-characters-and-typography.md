We all know the importance to choose a nice character before to start to type a letter or a document or whatever we may want to type and print. This is very important because the kind of character will have some effect on the persons who will read our text.

This is why in typography we have many different characters. There are [serif font and sans serif font][1]. Basically these two kinds of characters are at the origin of most characters.

## Serif and sans serif fonts

What does it means? A serif is a small line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter, it&rsquo;s a very small part of the letter which makes the difference. For example, the character &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a sans serif kind of font because at the end of the strokes there is no lines. On the opposite, &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a serif font having a very short line at the end of each stroke.

Serif letters comes from the Latin writing system, where words were basically carved into stones by Romans. So, it seems that when Roman painted the letters onto stone, the stone carvers tended to carve following the brush marks. These marks flared at the end of each stroke and the carvers reproduced exactly this flaring. This is just a theory.

Today serif and sans serif fonts are basically considered for their esthetical look. So, a serif letter looks more elegant and refined than a sans serif one, which is instead more practical to be used in technical manuals.

## Examples of sans serif fonts

The sans serif kind of font is also very appreciated in the web. Of course, in the web you may happen to see all kinds of characters, but if you pay attention to the criteria of the use, you can see that sans serif fonts are preferred to write informative pages and tutorials. They simply look easier to read.

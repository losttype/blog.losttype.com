There&#8217;s a really neat project brewing, by the name of Kern and Burn.

&#8220;*Kern and Burn is an online and print publication that curates discussions, interviews and essays. We invite design entrepreneurs—those who pursue self-initiated projects, think for themselves, and channel personal passions into self-made careers—to share their perspectives. They are designers who dream big and burn the midnight oil to forge their own paths.*&#8221;

They&#8217;ve decided to turn their blog into a book, and have started a [kickstarter project][1] to help fund it.

The Lost Type Co-Op was featured on day 35 of their &#8216;100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship&#8217;, and you can take a peak [here][2].

Watch the video, and please consider backing the project. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to taking a look at the final book.

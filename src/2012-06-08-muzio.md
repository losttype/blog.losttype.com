Today we took a stroll through the mission with [James Edmondson](http://jamestedmondson.com/) as our guide.

We saw lots of lovely type and hand-painted signs, we ate sandwiches, visited [826 Valencia](http://826valencia.org/), and a disabled person was even kind enough to lift my dress up for me while I was distracted documenting signage. Needless to say, our long walk through the Mission was eventful! Here are some highlights.

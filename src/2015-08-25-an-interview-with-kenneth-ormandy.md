__Name__ Kenneth Ormandy

## Where do you currently live and work?

I live and work in Vancouver, Canada, so technically, I might be the only non-remote Lost Type contributor.

## What discipline do you specialize in?

Web typography and front-end development. My interest in both is how I started working with Riley and Lost Type—first, developing the type tester we’re using today, then this blog, then [attending #fieldtripchi](http://blog.losttype.com/first-day-in-chicago/), and now some projects I can’t tell you about yet[.](http://kennethormandy.com/portfolio/implicate)

## What’s your typical day like?

I am lucky enough to have a pretty flexible work schedule. I usually head downtown on the bus and hopefully read a book instead of my Twitter feed. Next, I stop at [Timbertrain](http://timbertraincoffeeroasters.com/)—which features Lost Type’s [Tommaso](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=tommaso) on their coffee package tags—and then go to the [Chloi office](http://chloi.io/office) where I work on [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh), the service that hosts this very blog!

## How did you first get interested in typography and type design?

My two lowest marks in technical college were in typography and JavaScript, and now I write [massive articles about loading web fonts](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/efficient-web-type-circa-1556) using JS, so maybe that played a role. I don’t think there is a clear moment, though. I look back on the projects I’ve done and there was a thread of more and more typography-related work when I had the chance to do something different.

Jeff Strangman was a big influence as well

Getting <cite>Codex #1</cite> was also a big moment—perhaps pushing me from a casual user and observer of type into an inescapable obsession. It was designed by Working Format, a studio based in Vancouver (I wasn’t living there at the time) and I found out that 

## So… How do you feel about Hobo?

## Whats your favorite breakfast food?

Pancakes. Although I had multiple opportunities to eat pancakes during the field trip and chose other things instead, so who knows.

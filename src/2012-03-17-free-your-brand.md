A few months back [For Print Only](http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/archives/2011/11/free-your-brand-mailer.php) covered a nice mailer project by [MCM Communications](http://mcmcomm.net/), which features [Wisdom Script](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom%20script), [Deming](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=deming), [Duke](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=duke), [Aldine Expanded](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=aldine) and [Pompadour Numerals](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=pompadour) on a screen-printed box.

> The “Free Your Brand” box is a self-promo mailer from the agency to key prospective clients as a creative new business outreach strategy. Designed to match MCM’s brand standards and personality, the enclosed print piece tells a fast, yet funny story about the challenges and opportunities our clients face every day. The mailing box itself is designed as a teaser of what’s inside—inspiring higher open rates.

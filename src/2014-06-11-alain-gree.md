I recently discovered the work of the french illustrator Alain Grée (b. 1937). What struck me about his work is his unique combination of the technical — he loves diagramming and dissecting and much of his work features boats, planes, trains or machinery — and the childlike warmth and joy with which he draws.

Grée has illustrated more than 300 children&#8217;s books primarily during the 1960&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s, which were translated into over 20 languages. He also designed more than a dozen board games, and is a passionate sailor (which you can tell from his repetition of boats throughout his work).

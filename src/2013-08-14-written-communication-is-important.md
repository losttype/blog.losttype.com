Today we tend to give more importance to the images and videos we watch rather than to any written text. This is caused by the hurry we normally have when approaching something of information.

We want to be up-to-date in a minute or even less and we prefer to see a couple of images to understand what happened instead of reading a full [written text][1].

However, written words still keep all their importance.

## Writing skills for all occasions

Print media is going to get in crisis due to the fact that most people prefer to get information online.

However, you can still see how writing skills are important and, the less people pay attention to written texts, the more prestigious writing skills become. Simply because those persons who can write in a perfect way tend to be less and less.

Writing has still a big role. Even a few words could change the opinion people can depict in their mind about something. For example, the 2 or 3 written words on the top of a shop (that very often are the name of the shop itself) can convey the idea of a safety place or of a well provided place or of a friendly serviced place.

All depends from what kinds of words we choose to name the shop or any other kind of activity.

## A name to give a warranty

Very often we tend to concentrate what we want to say in just one word. And it&rsquo;s even harder to be able to find that magic word!

That&rsquo;s why we should think easier: first off, avoiding any additional information and just focusing on the main feature of the service or product we want to describe.

For example, the Locksmith service company has a very easy to remember name and a very easy to write name. It refers to <http://www.authorizedlocksmith.com> and it includes the idea of locks, relocked doors and key and of people who work behind these ones and many more services.

Locksmith is a service company made of experts and licensed people. Always offering a competitive price for important and urgent services.

In the name of Locksmith you can find and understand all this. Easy to keep in mind, Locksmith has a service office in every big city of the Country and in the most popular towns. So, no matter where you are, you can call the free phone number and be sure that you can get help in a short time.

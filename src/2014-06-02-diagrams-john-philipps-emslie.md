Well-designed infographics are fascinating, synthesizing huge quantities of numbers and details into understandable diagrams. Nicholas Felton’s insane [annual reports][1] have dominated this arena in the 21st century, but scientific engravers have been organizing and illustrating dense statistics for centuries.

John Philipps Emslie illustrated a large number of maps and contributed to the British topographical archive in the mid to late 1800s. These astronomical and geographical illustrations from his body of work are insane.

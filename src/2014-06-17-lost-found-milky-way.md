Milky Way is popular for their <a href="http://www.kawalingpinoy.com/2014/01/ginumis/" target="_blank">Halu-halo</a> (an assortment of fruits and beans with shaved ice, leche flan & ice cream) and Ice Cream, but I personally liked their <a href="http://www.kawalingpinoy.com/2014/01/ginumis/" target="_blank">Ginumis</a> more. When I went there over the weekend to try out their desserts, I was attracted to the cafe&#8217;s charming retro angular wordmark on the plates and saucers. The restaurant is currently using two different wordmarks: one for the <a href="http://cafe.milkywayrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Milkyway Cafe</a> which is the &#8220;updated&#8221; version of the one printed on their plates, and another one for the Deli. *About Milky Way: **&#8220;Established in the early 1950’s as a dairy bar in Old San Miguel, Milky Way is still a favorite among lovers of good, home-style Filipino cooking. The Famous Milky Way of ice creams, buco lechias sherbet, chicken asparagus sandwich and the best in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampango" target="_blank">Pampango</a> cuisine has 4 outlets to serve you in Makati City and in the Greenhills Shopping Center.&#8221;*

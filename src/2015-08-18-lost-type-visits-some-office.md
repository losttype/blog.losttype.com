The kind folks at Some Office, the Cards Against Humanity-run co-working space, gave us a tour during our [trip to Chicago](/fieldtripchi). Half the desks are occupied by _Cards_, as everyone affectionately called them for short.

The remainder of the desks house the work of game and graphic designers, illustrators, developers, and more. I also work in a [co-working space](http://chloi.io/office) with a number of independent teams, so I particularly enjoyed seeing what the freelancers and small teams were working on.

## Independent residents

A personal highlight of this visit was finding out [Greg Wohlwend](http://aeiowu.com/), creator one of my favourite iOS games, [Threes](http://threesgame.com), worked in the space. We also saw some behind the scenes work on a map for someone’s sustainable travel blog which was very impressive.

Books and boardgames—makes sense! There were also arcade games around, including a ten-person cabinet called <cite>Killer Queens</cite> I hadn’t seen since [XOXO](http://xoxo.com).

## Debbie Millman – Look Both Ways

Some Office also collaborated with the Chicago Design Museum to host a [Debbie Millman](http://debbiemillman.com/) exhibition. It was exciting for us to think we were about to leave the space, and find even more design work instead:

## Thank you cards

Thanks to Cards Against Humanity and everyone in the Some Office space for letting us hang out and having lunch with us. A special thanks to our new friend—[Frances’](http://losttype.com/font/?name=abraham_lincoln) old friend—[Dave of project](#) for organising everything, and showing us around! He gave us a sneak peak of a game he is working on, and you will definitely want to keep an eye out for that; follow him [on Twitter here](https://twitter.com/???).

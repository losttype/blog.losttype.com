The Lost Type Co-op’s Field Trip bring together a group of talented graphic designers, type designers, and lettering artists, for a site-specific marathon of collaboration. We’re heading to Salt Lake City for [#fieldtripslc](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/fieldtripslc).

Hosted by [Danelle Cheney](http://www.danellecheney.com/), one of Lost Type’s most regular contributors, we’ll be touring the city, working together, and meeting the design community in Salt Lake City.
